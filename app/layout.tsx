 * `noindex`, and a layout-wide `index, follow` would land on that same page as a contradictory
 * directive. `index, follow` is the default anyway, so the only part worth declaring is the preview
 * sizing — and that belongs on the two real pages, which declare it themselves.
 *
 * No `keywords` either. The major engines ignore it, Bing has publicly described it as a spam
 * signal, and the discoverability that actually works here is the title, the description, the
 * canonical URL, and the sitemap.

          Without it, a Limestone reader gets a full-page flash of the Fieldline ground on every
          navigation, because the served HTML is cacheable and therefore always carries the
          default. The script is a bounded allowlist check over one `localStorage` key and is
          total: any storage failure falls through to the default rather than throwing before
          hydration. `chassis.test.ts` holds it to that shape and to being unable to close its own
          script element.
